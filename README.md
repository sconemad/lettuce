# lettuce
Networked embedded automation platform

**Note:** the lettuce system was developed between 2006-2010, and is no longer being actively developed.

Lettuce aims to be a networked embedded automation platform that is both lightweight and extensible. 
Its applications include automation, control and entertainment systems in the home, but is also suitable for use in industry.
