Lettuce-v1.0 errata

2008-04-29 Lettuce-v1.0.1

  * aux: PWM outputs (J2,J3) pin 2 should connect to PWM power not +3.3v.
    [updated PCB]

  * rs232lin: LINBus power should be isolated from +3.3v and R2.
    [updated PCB]

  * ioport-busrelay: L,N,E track widths limit max current to 5A, may be room 
    to enlarge? 180mil would allow 10A with T+20degC, 13A with T+38degC

  * ioport-input: Diode holes too small.

  * ioport: MCP23S17 pin 18 (!RESET) grounded, holding device in reset!
    Should connect to +3.3v.
    [updated PCB]

  * aux: Corner of aux board can touch ferrite bead L1 on main board. This
    shorts +3.3v to Gnd.
    [updated PCB]

  * aux: Comparator -ve inputs should be biased to 1/2 supply, need to add a
    further 10K resistor for each.

  * ioport: Need to add decoupling caps, essenial to cope with mains noise.

  * core: R9, R10 labels inverted.
    [fixed v1.0.1]

  * core: J1 header too close to J2 so cannot plug in Pickit-2 programmer.
    Can work around by:
    - Programming before soldering these components.
    - Use R/A header for J1 (though this obscures text on silkscreen).
    - Use extension cable when using Pickit-2 programmer.

  * core: X1 too close to C4,C1,C2,R18.
    Can work around by raising X1 slightly. Some insulation would help too.
    [spacing increased in v1.0.1]

  * rs232: RS-232 header pinouts incorrect.
    [fixed v1.0.1]
